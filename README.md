# Bitcoin Forecasting

This project focuses on forecasting two key variables: **Close Price** and **Daily Volatility**.

- **Close Price** is predicted using three models: ARIMA, Random Forest (RF), and LSTM. The LSTM model employs both **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** and **Grid Search (GS)** for hyperparameter tuning.
  
- **Daily Volatility** is forecasted using GARCH, Random Forest (RF), and LSTM, with hyperparameters optimized through **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** and **Grid Search (GS)**.

The project also includes descriptive statistics of the dataset.

All results are consolidated into a single file for each variable, allowing for a comprehensive comparison of methods and performance.
